Background
---

In 1984, William Cleveland and Robert McGill published the results of several controlled experiments that pitted bar charts against pies and stacked-bar variants. 
Their paper (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/courses/cpsc533c-04-spr/readings/cleveland.pdf) (http://info.slis.indiana.edu/~katy/S637-S11/cleveland84.pdf) is considered a key paper in data visualization.
In particular, they ran a psychology-style experiment where users were shown a series of randomly-generated charts with two graphical elements marked like this:

Participants were then asked, "What percentage is the smaller of the larger?". 
This was repeated hundreds of time with varying data and charts. 
By the end of the study, Cleveland and McGill had amassed a large dataset that looked like this:

![cleveland table](img/cleveland-table.png)

__Log-base-2 or "cm-error"__: The true percent is the actual percentage of the smaller to the larger, while the reported percent is what participants reported. 
Cleveland and McGill recognized that their analyses would be biased if they took `abs(ReportedPercent – TruePercent)` as their score for error. 
To compensate, they came up with a logarithmic scale for error with this equation:

You’ll be implementing this error score as part of the lab. 
(Hint: it’s not a trick question, this is just to familiarize you with the experiment protocol). 
With this Cleveland-McGill error score you can better compare the performance of the charts you test to figure out which one performs the best.

As a baseline, compare your average Error scores to the following chart, which include both Cleveland and McGill’s results as well as more recent extensions of this experiment (lower error indicates better performance, and error bars are bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval#Meaning_and_interpretation`)):
